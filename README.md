DriverPass project, Business requirement documents and system design document.

The client was DriverPass, A company that hoped to company that hoped to provide training
to those who were expecting to take their driver test at their local DMV.
They wanted to create an online website which users can access with numerous different devices
This system would utilize cloud databases to help reach their requirements. Their services
would be delivered through this website.

I designed the activity diagrams and identified the goals, purposes and backgrounds from the
interview particularly well. I abstracted the necesary requirements from the inital interview
and interpreted them those requirements to those tasks very well. 

I would like to revise the platform constraints from the business requirements documents. I 
wish to add more details about Linux's numerous strenghs and give a deeper explaination on why higher
expertise could potentially be needed. Additinal comparisons to other specific platforms would also 
stengthen this section within my document.

The interview was the only way the users needs were conveyed for this project. In the interview 
represented of driverpass expressed there numerous needs and prefferences within the system. If 
their were potential issues that can impede with the clients needs, it was addressed at the 
interview. The needs of the client is critical to delivering the proper system that will address 
their purposes, goals and backgrounds. The system is for the client and it should accurately be
the clients desires, needs and preferrences above any other parties. 

I have learned many new techniques and strategies that can greatly improve my approach to designing 
software. I can now identify the differences to functional and non-functional requirements or the 
differences between object parts or functional parts. I know how to identify use cases and the 
sequences or uses of data. With this knowledge I can properly seperate software into these proper
definitions and aspects that can greatly organize my approach and give me a stronger understanding
of software.
